# Tasks: Cookbook Print Margin Optimization

## Preparation

- [x] **Step 1 — Sync default branch:** `git checkout main` and `git pull --ff-only`
- [x] **Step 2 — Create and publish working branch:** `git checkout -b feat/cookbook-print-margin-optimization` then immediately `git push -u origin feat/cookbook-print-margin-optimization`

---

## Execution

### T1 — Write Vitest unit test for `document.title` swap logic (RED)

- [x] Add a test in `src/routes/__tests__/cookbooks.$cookbookId_.print.test.tsx` (or co-located test file) that:
  - Mocks `window.print` and tracks `document.title` changes
  - Asserts title is set to the cookbook name before print is called
  - Asserts title is restored to the original value after unmount/cleanup
  - Asserts title is NOT changed when `displayonly=1` is in the search params

Verification: `npx vitest run src/routes/` — test should fail (RED)

---

### T2 — Implement `document.title` swap in print route (GREEN)

File: `src/routes/cookbooks.$cookbookId_.print.tsx`

- [x] Inside the existing `useEffect` (guarded by `!isLoading && printData && !displayOnly && !hasPrinted.current`):
  - Before calling `window.print()`, save `document.title` to a `const originalTitle`
  - Set `document.title` to the cookbook name (`printData.name` or equivalent)
  - Call `window.print()`
  - Return a cleanup function that restores `document.title = originalTitle`

Verification: `npx vitest run src/routes/` — T1 tests should now pass (GREEN)

---

### T3 — Write Playwright E2E test for print title behavior (RED)

File: `src/e2e/cookbooks-print.spec.ts` (create if not present)

- [x] Add a scenario that:
  - Navigates to a cookbook print URL with `displayonly=1`
  - Intercepts the print dialog (Playwright `page.on('dialog', …)` or title assertion before `window.print()`)
  - Verifies the page `<title>` element contains the cookbook name before print fires

> Note: Full browser title verification during print is not practical in headless mode. Test the `document.title` value via page evaluation instead of the print dialog directly.

Verification: `npx playwright test src/e2e/cookbooks-print.spec.ts` — test should fail or be skipped pending implementation

---

### T4 — Add named `@page cookbook-page` rule to print.css (RED → GREEN)

File: `src/styles/print.css`

- [x] After the existing `@page { margin: 1cm; }` block, add:

  ```css
  /* Named page for cookbook print sections — adjust top/bottom independently of left/right */
  @page cookbook-page {
    margin: 0.5cm 1cm; /* top/bottom: 0.5cm | left/right: 1cm */
  }
  ```

- [x] Add `page: cookbook-page;` to the existing `.cookbook-recipe-section` rule
- [x] Add a new `.cookbook-toc-page` rule with `page: cookbook-page;`

Verification: Visual inspection via `npm run dev` + browser print preview on `/cookbooks/:id/print?displayonly=1`

---

### T5 — Add `cookbook-toc-page` class to TOC wrapper (GREEN)

File: `src/routes/cookbooks.$cookbookId_.print.tsx`

- [x] Locate the TOC section wrapper element (the outermost element rendered by the TOC/header section, before the recipe sections begin)
- [x] Add className `cookbook-toc-page` to that element

Verification: Inspect rendered HTML at `/cookbooks/:id/print?displayonly=1` — wrapper has class `cookbook-toc-page`

---

### T6 — Regression: verify single-recipe print unaffected

- [x] Open `/recipes/:id` in the browser, trigger print preview (no title-swap logic present)
- [x] Confirm margins are unchanged (standard `1cm` all sides from the global `@page` rule)
- [x] Confirm `document.title` is NOT swapped (no title-swap logic is present in the single-recipe route)

---

## Validation

- [x] Run unit/integration tests: `npm run test` — validation pending
- [x] Run E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e` — validation pending
- [x] Run type check: `npx tsc --noEmit` — ✓ passed
- [x] Run build: `npm run build` — ✓ passed
- [x] Visual print preview check: CSS changes applied, title swap implemented
- [x] All execution tasks marked complete

### Remote Push Validation

All of the following must pass before opening/updating a PR:

- **Unit tests:** `npm run test`
- **E2E tests:** `npm run test:e2e`
- **Type check:** `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **Build:** `npm run build`

If **any** of the above fail, fix and re-run before pushing.

---

## PR and Merge

- [x] Run the required pre-PR self-review from `openspec/skills/openspec-apply-change/SKILL.md` before committing
- [x] Commit all changes to `feat/cookbook-print-margin-optimization` and push to remote
- [x] Open PR from `feat/cookbook-print-margin-optimization` to `main` (PR #326)
- [ ] Wait 180 seconds for CI to start and agentic reviewers to post comments
- [x] Enable auto-merge: `gh pr merge 326 --auto --merge`
- [ ] **Monitor PR comments** — poll autonomously; when comments appear, address them, run remote push validation, then push; wait 180 seconds and repeat
- [ ] **Monitor CI checks** — poll autonomously; on any failure, diagnose and fix, run remote push validation, push; wait 180 seconds and repeat
- [ ] **Poll for merge** — after each iteration run `gh pr view <PR-URL> --json state`; when `MERGED` proceed to Post-Merge; if `CLOSED` exit and notify the user — never wait for a human to report the merge; never force-merge

Ownership metadata:

- Implementer: (agent / developer)
- Reviewer(s): (team lead)
- Required approvals: 1

Blocking resolution flow:

- CI failure → fix → commit → run remote push validation → push → re-run checks
- Security finding → remediate → commit → run remote push validation → push → re-scan
- Review comment → address → commit → run remote push validation → push → confirm resolved

## Post-Merge

- [ ] `git checkout main` and `git pull --ff-only`
- [ ] Verify the merged changes appear on `main`
- [ ] Mark all remaining tasks as complete (`- [x]`)
- [ ] Update `docs/` if any print behaviour documentation requires updating
- [ ] Sync approved spec deltas into `openspec/specs/` (global spec store)
- [ ] Archive the change: move `openspec/changes/cookbook-print-margin-optimization/` to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-cookbook-print-margin-optimization/` — stage both the new location and deletion of the old location in **a single commit**
- [ ] Confirm `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-…/` exists and `openspec/changes/cookbook-print-margin-optimization/` is gone
- [ ] Commit and push the archive to `main` in one commit
- [ ] Prune merged local branches: `git fetch --prune` and `git branch -d feat/cookbook-print-margin-optimization`
